 Born in San Diego, California, I'm a rising senior graduating with a BS in Statistics with a concentration in Statistical Computing & a minor in Public Policy @ UC Riverside in Spring 2022. 

I'm interested in using Data Science & analytical tools such as GIS technology & visualization tools to offer insights on social issues and influence [policy] change. Topics of interest include transportation, political participation, & food security. I have some of my [projects on display here](Projects.html). 

I cherish open-mindedness, skepticism, tolerance, humanity, & truth above all. As an advocate for an informed public, I believe in the accessibility of information & data in both the sense of open-access & in that I value readability. 

Currently seeking opportunities, especially those that involve both data analysis & GIS technology, even more so if they involve social issues or the gaming industry.
